    <h2>An Artical About The Recent flood In Sylhet</h2>
<p><img src="icon5.svg" alt="">In the last few weeks, millions of people in the Sylhet and Sunamganj districts have experienced heavy rains and flash floods, leaving them homeless and without possessions. With homes crushed, objects floating away and people missing, the country is at high alert. This is not the first time the northeastern region (Sylhet) of Bangladesh is experiencing these floods, which have occurred twice already in 2022 alone. Now, they have begun again, starting in May 2022 with heavy rains battering the area, rivers overflowing, and excess water sweeping through the region. Since 17th June, the situation has dramatically worsened and affected additional districts, increasing the magnitude and scale of damage. Around a quarter of the country is now flooded.</p>
